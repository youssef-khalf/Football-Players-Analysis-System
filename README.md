# 🏆 Football Game Analysis with YOLOv8 and Computer Vision

This project uses state-of-the-art object detection and tracking techniques to analyze football games. Leveraging **YOLOv8**, **optical flow**, and **perspective transformation**, it provides a comprehensive solution for detecting and tracking players, referees, and footballs, measuring player movement, and calculating speed and distance covered during the game.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔍 YOLOv8 Object Detection**: Detect players, referees, and footballs in images and videos.
- **🔧 Custom YOLO Model**: Fine-tune YOLOv8 on a custom dataset for enhanced detection.
- **👕 Team Assignment**: Segment players by t-shirt color using **KMeans clustering**.
- **📏 Movement Tracking**: Measure player movement with **optical flow** between frames.
- **🔲 Perspective Transformation**: Adjust for depth and perspective to measure real-world player movement in meters.
- **🏃‍♂️ Speed & Distance Calculation**: Track player speed and distance covered during the game.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-game-analysis.git
cd football-game-analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the YOLOv8 Model

```bash
python -m ultralytics.yolo.v8
```

---

## 🛠 Usage

### Detect Objects in Videos

Run the detection script on a video:

```bash
python detect.py --input your_video.mp4 --output output_video.mp4
```

### Train Custom YOLOv8 Model

Fine-tune YOLOv8 on your own dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data your_dataset.yaml --cfg yolov8.yaml
```

### Segment Players and Calculate Movement

Segment players and track movement in the video:

```bash
python segment_and_track.py --input your_video.mp4
```

## ⚙ Key Concepts

### **YOLOv8 Object Detection**

A fast and accurate object detection algorithm that is used to identify players, referees, and footballs in the video.

### **KMeans Clustering**

Used for t-shirt color segmentation to assign players to teams based on the color of their shirts.

### **Optical Flow**

This technique is used to measure camera movement between frames, allowing for accurate tracking of player movement across the video.

### **Perspective Transformation**

Adjusts the video’s perspective, allowing the calculation of player movement in real-world distances (meters) instead of pixels.

### **Speed and Distance Calculation**

Based on the tracked movement, this feature calculates the speed and distance covered by players during the game.
